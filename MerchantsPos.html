                            <p>A virtual terminal is an online credit card terminal that allows merchants to take over-the-phone orders as well as online transactions through a secure and compliant web-based application. In lieu of hardware equipment, a virtual terminal will allow your business to process credit cards, debit cards, and even electronic checks. The only thing required is a gateway ID supplied by your provider, a standard web browser, and access to the internet.Virtual credit card terminals feature an online form to input customer information for MOTO order (Mail Order Telephone Order). Information such as the customer name, account details, as well as the amount & frequency of the transactions, are a part of a basic online terminal form. Submissions of this type couldn’t be easier and approval is nearly instant.

                            <h6>SHOPPING CART</h6>
                            <p>Shopping carts are an important part of the e-commerce experience. When people shop on your website, they add everything to a shopping cart. Often, there’s a shopping cart icon on the site, too, that lets people know how many items are in there. Once they’re ready to check out, they go to their shopping cart to view what’s inside, confirm the quantities, and then complete the check-out process.
                                You want to make it as easy as possible for people to check out with their shopping carts. If it’s a complicated process, people will abandon their cart and you will lose out on their business. At TSservices, we provide merchant processing solutions to assist with this aspect. Our services will integrate with any shopping cart that you have in place. If you want to be sure about compatibility please shoot us a quick message and we will respond promptly.
                                Whether you need a traditional merchant processing account or a high-risk one, you need to be able to accept credit cards. We make accepting Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express easier than ever before. Plus, we provide a secure solution so your customers trust the transactions and you don’t have to worry about fraud or compromised customer data.
                                Our open API design connects with your shopping cart, regardless of what solution you have in place. It’s one less thing for you to worry about when setting up your e-commerce store.
                                At TSservices, we make it easy. Simply choose us as your merchant account provider and we will take care of the rest. We will integrate quickly with your shopping cart so that people can complete their orders without any headache. The credit cards are processed fast and they get their order confirmation. You then get the payment so that you can start fulfilling orders.
                                Call or fill out the form today to start the application process. We can connect with your shopping cart and help you start accepting credit cards right away.

                            <p>Chances are you’ve landed on this page because you want to see if TSservices can integrate with your system seamlessly. The answer is almost always yes. Any CMS like Shopify, WooCommerce, Wordpress, Wix or many others that allow for third party gateway integration or have an open API we can work with. You won’t see TSservices as an actual dropdown in your payments setting, however you will see many other gateways that we will be able to connect you through.
                                Once you are approved for a merchant account we need to connect a gateway to it. The most popular gateway that you probably heard of is Authorize.net (a VISA company). Not only can we connect with them, we are compatible with almost every gateway in existence. Rest assured, we will handle this integration part of the deployment process for you so you don’t need to get a programmer involved.
